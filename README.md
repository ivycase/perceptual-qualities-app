### Running the app

1. In the project directory, run:
   ```shell
    npx expo start
   ```
2. There are several ways to test the app:
     - **Expo Go (Recommended)**: [download Expo Go](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#2-expo-go-app-for-android-and) on your phone, **connect to same network as your laptop**, and use your phone camera to scan the QR code displayed in the command line.
     -  Web: typing `w` into the expo command line opens the app in a web view. 
        -  Warning: since the app is designed to be used on a mobile app, web compatibility might be limited, and some functionality might be different when using the web setup.
